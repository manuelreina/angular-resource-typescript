Angular Resource + Typescript using generics

I wanted to use angular resource without coding a resource factory for every entity and I came up with this project.
Using typescript and generics we can achieve it. Have a look to the resourceService.ts file you will see.

I have used angular-mocks and a dataService for the backend.
In order to give a little bit of life to the page I used angular-material.

You can see a running example <a href="http://manuelreina.github.io/angular-resource-typescript/">here</a>:
